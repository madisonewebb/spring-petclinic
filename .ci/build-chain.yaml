# Challenge: Create GitHub Action jobs to build dependent artifacts when the artifacts
# they depend on are built successfully. (on successful artifact build of joda-time, the
# spring-petclinic should get built as well)
version: "2.2"

# Define your project graph here. For a single-repo setup you can leave it empty for now
# and add entries like:
# dependencies:
#   - project: YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO
#     dependencies: []
dependencies:
  - project: madisonewebb/joda-time
    dependencies: []
  - project: madisonewebb/spring-petclinic
    dependencies:
      - project: madisonewebb/joda-time

# Default build command for the current project. Adjust as needed.
default:
  build-command:
    current: mvn -B -ntp -DskipTests install

# Map per-project overrides. When you add your project to dependencies, add a matching
# entry here, e.g.:
# build:
#   - project: YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO
#     build-command:
#       current: ./mvnw -B -ntp verify
build:
  - project: madisonewebb/joda-time
    skip: true
  - project: madisonewebb/spring-petclinic
    build-command:
      current: ./mvnw -B -ntp verify
